//! Ask the agent what each persona presents, for the communities panel.
//!
//! Mirrors [`agent_name_refresh`](super::agent_name_refresh): the loop collects
//! targets, this resolves them off-thread, and the outcome is folded back into
//! state on the loop.
//!
//! Two differences from that module, both deliberate.
//!
//! **Nothing here is persisted.** An agent name is a property of a DID document
//! that rarely changes and costs a resolve to establish, so its cache lives in
//! `ProtectedConfig` and survives a relaunch. A binding is the holder's own
//! current decision, one trust task away, and editable from `pnm` between one
//! launch and the next — a persisted copy would show what they used to present
//! on the one panel whose job is to say what they present now.
//!
//! **A failure is an answer, and a different one from "nothing".** Every target
//! resolves to a [`BindingSummary`], with `unknown` set when the agent could not
//! be asked. Dropping failures from the map would leave those rows absent, and
//! an absent row renders identically to a persona bound to nothing — which is
//! the one confusion this whole surface must not create.
