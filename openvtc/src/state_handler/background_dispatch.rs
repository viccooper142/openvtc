//! Background-dispatch pattern for network-bound runtime actions (R13).
//!
//! # The problem
//!
//! The runtime `tokio::select!` loop in [`super`] services exactly one arm at a
//! time. Several action dispatches `.await` network I/O *inline* in their arm,
//! so the whole loop is parked for the duration. The worst case is a mediator
//! change / reconnect, which calls
//! [`super::didcomm::reconnect_persona_listener_io`] and waits up to **30
//! seconds** for the listener to connect (`wait_connected(.., 30s)`). While that
//! future is
//! pending, no other select arm runs: queued keystrokes pile up, inbound DIDComm
//! events in the bounded channel get dropped, and even `q` / Exit is dead.
//!
//! # The pattern
//!
//! Startup already solves this (`super::StateHandler::main_loop`'s
//! `MainPageDeferred` arm): the slow load runs as a spawned task that streams
//! progress/completion back into a responsive select loop over a channel. This
//! module generalises that for *runtime* actions:
//!
//! * The background task does **I/O only** and returns a [`DispatchOutcome`]
//!   over an mpsc the loop owns.
//! * **All mutation stays on the loop thread**: a dedicated select arm applies
//!   the outcome (config changes, save/sync helpers, status), so the
//!   single-mutator / unidirectional-data-flow invariant is preserved.
//! * A per-domain [`InFlight`] busy-guard rejects a second action on a busy
//!   domain with a visible status message instead of running it concurrently or
//!   queueing it blind — matching today's effectively-serialised behaviour.
//!
//! R13 migrates the mediator change/reconnect path as the single proving case;
//! R14 migrates the remaining network dispatches onto the same mechanism.
